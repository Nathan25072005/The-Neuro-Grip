## The-Neuro-Grip
This project fuses clinical rehabilitation with an engaging video game to improve patient engagement. A patient uses a multi-sensor ball to play a maze game, replacing subjective tests with data-driven interaction. The system generates a precise, quantitative clinical report for doctors that can be shared remotely.
